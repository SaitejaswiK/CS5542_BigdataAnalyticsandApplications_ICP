# CS5542_BigdataAnalyticsandApplications_ICP-5
In this ICP we have run the CNN classifier model successfully without any errors and then replaced the dataset with our project dataset. 
Also accomplished the task of tensforboard successfully.

Another module that successfully  completed was Inception layer and replaced our own dataset for training the model.


Complications:

Couldn't place the Inception model source code into Github because of its size restriction.
